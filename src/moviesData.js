    description: `It is Christmas time and the McCallister family is
          preparing for a vacation in Paris, France. But the youngest in the
          family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older
          brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was sent to his room, which is on the
          third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of
          the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they
          completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself.
          Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself,
          jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers
          about two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), about
          to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his
          own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring
          them to justice.`,
